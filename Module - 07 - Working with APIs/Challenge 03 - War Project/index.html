<!--
    Synchronous JavaScript
        Each command must complete before the next command can execute.
        No two commands can be running at the same time.
    Asynchronous JavaScript
        Code that can run "out of order". Allow a lengthy operation to start, but finish at a later time without
        blocking other code from running in the meantime.
        JavaScript isn't truly asynchronoues, but rather has "callback" mechanisms in place to run commands in a
        different orfer to make things more efficient.
        JavaScrip is single-threaded, it means only one command can run at a time.
    
    Promises
        Pending: The promise has yet to be completed.
        Fullfilled: The promise was completed as promised. (then() method)
            When a promise is fullfilled run the .then() block
        Rejected: The promises was not completed as promised.

        Promise object, is an special object in JavaScript

    
    
    *Functions are a first-class object in JavaScrip
    *Callback function, are called later, on event listener we can write the function and call it later, instead of write an anonymouse function.
